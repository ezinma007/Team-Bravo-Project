# Project
You need to take control of your finances. To do so you need to create an automated budget spreadsheet

This spreadsheet receives input parameters like your monthly income, 10 expense categories, and the financial expense amounts for those 10 categories

All you have to do is input the necessary spends on a daily basis and the sheet should automatically generate necessary charts showing budget spends for that month. 

If you can, account for input dates and make the budget account for a 12 month period with accompanying charts, great!

PS: Your charts should be on a different sheet from the budget calculator.
